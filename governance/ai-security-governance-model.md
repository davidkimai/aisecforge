# AI Security Governance Model

This document outlines a comprehensive governance structure for managing adversarial security risks in AI systems, establishing clear organizational responsibilities, oversight mechanisms, and accountability frameworks.

## Governance Structure Overview

The AI security governance model is structured in five interconnected layers:

1. **Strategic Governance**: Board and executive leadership
2. **Tactical Oversight**: Security management and program governance
3. **Operational Implementation**: Day-to-day security operations
4. **Technical Execution**: Security engineering and technical controls
5. **Verification & Validation**: Independent assessment and assurance

This layered approach ensures that security governance extends from strategic direction through to technical implementation and independent validation.
