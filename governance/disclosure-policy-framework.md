## Disclosure Process Framework

### Disclosure Timeline Management

Structured approach to disclosure timing:

| Phase | Timing Guidance | Flexibility Factors | Communication Expectations |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Initial Response | 1-2 business days | Report volume, staffing availability | Acknowledge receipt, set expectations for validation |
| Validation | 5-10 business days | Technical complexity, reproducibility challenges | Communicate validation status, severity assessment |
| Remediation Planning | 7-14 days from validation | Vulnerability complexity, system dependencies | Share remediation approach, timeline expectations |
| Remediation Implementation | Based on severity (30-90 days) | Technical complexity, testing requirements, deployment considerations | Provide regular progress updates, timeline adjustments |
| Public Disclosure | 30-90 days post-remediation | Exploitation risk, coordination requirements, verification needs | Coordinate timing, content, and approach with researcher |

### Stakeholder Coordination

Framework for managing disclosure across stakeholders:

| Stakeholder | Involvement Timing | Information Requirements | Coordination Approach |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Internal Teams | Early in process | Vulnerability details, impact assessment, remediation requirements | Regular coordination meetings, shared communication channels |
| Affected Partners | After validation and impact assessment | Vulnerability impact, mitigation options, timing expectations | Private notification, coordinated remediation, joint disclosure planning |
| Researcher | Throughout process | Status updates, remediation approach, disclosure timing | Regular updates, disclosure coordination, recognition planning |
| Customers/Users | Based on disclosure strategy | Impact explanation, remediation status, required actions | Coordinated communication plan, appropriate detail level |
| Industry Groups | When broader impact possible | Anonymized vulnerability information, industry implications | Information sharing through appropriate channels |

### Disclosure Content Development

Guidelines for creating effective disclosure content:

| Content Element | Purpose | Development Guidance | Examples |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------|----------|
| Vulnerability Description | Clear explanation of the issue | Balance technical accuracy with accessibility, avoid enabling exploitation | "A vulnerability in the model's parameter handling allowed potential extraction of training data under specific conditions" |
| Technical Details | Sufficient information for understanding | Provide meaningful technical context without exploitation enablement | "The vulnerability involved a specific pattern of API calls that could reveal model parameter information" |
| Impact Assessment | Explanation of security implications | Clear description of realistic impact, avoid speculation | "This vulnerability could allow an attacker to extract limited information about model configuration" |
| Remediation Information | How the issue was addressed | Describe approach without creating new vulnerabilities | "We have implemented enhanced parameter validation and monitoring to address this vulnerability" |
| Lessons Learned | Broader security improvements | Share valuable insights for community benefit | "This finding has led us to implement more rigorous API endpoint security testing" |

## Communication Strategy
