# Test Execution Protocols

This document outlines standardized procedures for implementing security tests within the AISecForge framework. Following these protocols ensures consistent, reproducible, and comprehensive security assessments across different models and evaluators.

## General Execution Principles

### 1. Controlled Testing Environment

All security testing must be conducted in isolated environments to prevent unintended exposure of vulnerabilities or harmful outputs.

#### Requirements

- Isolated network environment or appropriate API sandboxing
- Access controls limiting exposure to authorized testers only
- Logging systems capturing all interactions
- Prohibition on testing against production systems
- Appropriate data handling procedures for any sensitive outputs

#### Implementation Steps

1. Configure testing environment with appropriate isolation
2. Verify logging systems are operational
3. Confirm access controls are in place
4. Document environment configuration for reproducibility

### 2. Systematic Test Progression

Testing should follow a systematic progression from basic to advanced techniques, ensuring comprehensive coverage while efficiently identifying vulnerabilities.

#### Testing Phases

1. **Baseline Testing**: Establish model's standard behavior and response patterns
2. **Basic Vulnerability Testing**: Implement fundamental test cases for each security dimension
3. **Advanced Technique Testing**: Apply sophisticated variations of each attack vector
4. **Combined Vector Testing**: Test interactions between different vulnerability classes
5. **Persistent Testing**: Evaluate degradation over extended interactions
6. **Edge Case Testing**: Explore boundary conditions and rare scenarios

#### Implementation Steps

1. Develop test plan detailing progression through phases
2. Document completion criteria for each phase
3. Maintain dependencies between phases (e.g., advanced testing builds on basic results)
4. Track coverage across dimensions and techniques

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

All testing activities must be thoroughly documented to ensure reproducibility, support analysis, and enable remediation.

#### Documentation Requirements

- Detailed test case descriptions
- Exact inputs used (including any randomization parameters)

## Quality Control

To ensure testing quality and consistency:

3. **Comparative Analysis**: Results should be compared across similar models when possible
4. **Historical Comparison**: Current results should be compared against previous assessments

## Ethical Considerations

All testing must adhere to these ethical guidelines:

1. Testing must occur in isolated, controlled environments
2. No exposure of vulnerable models to the public
3. Responsible disclosure to model developers before publication
4. Focus on defensive improvements rather than exploitation
5. Prohibition of techniques that could cause broader harm
