# AISecForge Methodology

This directory contains the core methodological frameworks used for systematic evaluation of large language model security. The approaches documented here provide structured, reproducible methods for assessing AI system vulnerabilities across multiple dimensions.

## Core Methodology Documents

### Foundational Frameworks

- [**Testing Principles**](principles.md): Core principles guiding all AISecForge testing methodologies
- [**Assessment Dimensions**](dimensions.md): The key security dimensions evaluated in our framework
- [**Scoring System**](scoring.md): Standardized metrics for quantifying and comparing security posture
- [**Vulnerability Classification**](classification.md): Taxonomy for categorizing and describing identified issues

### Implementation Guides

- [**Test Development**](test-development.md): Guidelines for creating effective security test cases
- [**Execution Protocols**](execution.md): Standardized procedures for test implementation
- [**Analysis Framework**](analysis.md): Systematic approaches to evaluating test results
- [**Reporting Standards**](reporting.md): Templates and guidelines for security assessment reporting

## Dimension-Specific Methodologies

Each security dimension has its own specialized testing methodology:

- [**Linguistic Pattern Testing**](dimensions/linguistic.md)
- [**Contextual Boundary Assessment**](dimensions/contextual.md)
- [**System Prompt Extraction**](dimensions/system-prompt.md)
- [**Multi-turn Vulnerability Evaluation**](dimensions/multi-turn.md)
- [**Multimodal Attack Vectors**](dimensions/multimodal.md)
- [**Tool Use Security**](dimensions/tool-use.md)

## Methodology Versioning

Our methodologies follow semantic versioning:

- **Major versions**: Fundamental changes to assessment dimensions or principles
- **Minor versions**: Addition of new testing methodologies or significant refinements
- **Patch versions**: Clarifications, corrections, or minor improvements

The current methodology version is: `v1.0.0`

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve these methodologies. Please see our [contribution guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to submit improvements or extensions to our testing approaches.

## Implementation Notes

When implementing these methodologies, consider the following:

1. **Start with dimensional scoping**: Determine which security dimensions are most relevant to the system under test
2. **Establish a baseline**: Run standard tests to establish a security baseline before specialized testing
3. **Progressive complexity**: Begin with basic tests before moving to more sophisticated attack vectors
4. **Comprehensive documentation**: Record all testing steps, including unsuccessful attempts
5. **Cross-dimensional analysis**: Look for security issues that span multiple dimensions

For detailed implementation examples, refer to the [case studies](../case-studies/) directory.
