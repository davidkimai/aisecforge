## Scoring Methodology

MERIT uses a systematic calculation approach:

```python
# Pseudocode for MERIT calculation
def calculate_merit(scores):
    # Calculate dimension scores
    tc_score = (scores['TC1'] * 0.20 + scores['TC2'] * 0.25 + scores['TC3'] * 0.20 + 
               scores['TC4'] * 0.15 + scores['TC5'] * 0.20)
    
    rr_score = (scores['RR1'] * 0.25 + scores['RR2'] * 0.20 + scores['RR3'] * 0.15 + 
               scores['RR4'] * 0.20 + scores['RR5'] * 0.20)
    
    ar_score = (scores['AR1'] * 0.25 + scores['AR2'] * 0.20 + scores['AR3'] * 0.15 + 
               scores['AR4'] * 0.20 + scores['AR5'] * 0.20)
    
    er_score = (scores['ER1'] * 0.30 + scores['ER2'] * 0.20 + scores['ER3'] * 0.25 + 
               scores['ER4'] * 0.15 + scores['ER5'] * 0.10)
    
    de_score = (scores['DE1'] * 0.25 + scores['DE2'] * 0.20 + scores['DE3'] * 0.15 + 
               scores['DE4'] * 0.25 + scores['DE5'] * 0.15)
    
    # Calculate Exploitation Potential (inverse of technical complexity and resource requirements)
    # Higher scores mean easier exploitation
    exploitation_potential = (10 - tc_score) * 0.5 + (10 - rr_score) * 0.5
    
    # Calculate Access Feasibility (inverse of access requirements)
    # Higher scores mean more feasible access
    access_feasibility = 10 - ar_score
    
    # Calculate Success Likelihood (direct from exploitation reliability)
    success_likelihood = er_score
    
    # Calculate Stealth Factor (direct from detection evasion)
    stealth_factor = de_score
    
    # Calculate overall MERIT score (0-100 scale)
    # Higher scores indicate higher exploitation risk
    merit_score = ((exploitation_potential * 0.35) + (access_feasibility * 0.15) + 
                  (success_likelihood * 0.30) + (stealth_factor * 0.20)) * 10
    
    # Determine exploitation risk category
    if merit_score >= 80:
        risk_category = "Critical Exploitation Risk"
    elif merit_score >= 60:
        risk_category = "High Exploitation Risk"
    elif merit_score >= 40:
        risk_category = "Medium Exploitation Risk"
    elif merit_score >= 20:
        risk_category = "Low Exploitation Risk"
    else:
        risk_category = "Minimal Exploitation Risk"
    
    return {
        "dimension_scores": {
            "Technical Complexity": tc_score,
            "Resource Requirements": rr_score,
            "Access Requirements": ar_score,
            "Exploitation Reliability": er_score,
