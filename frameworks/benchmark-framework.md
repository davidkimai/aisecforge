# AI Security Risk Benchmarking Framework

This document outlines a comprehensive framework for standardized evaluation and quantitative benchmarking of security risks in large language models. The framework enables comparative analysis across different models, versions, and architectures while providing actionable metrics for security improvement.

## Framework Foundations

### Core Design Principles

The benchmarking framework is built on five foundational principles:

1. **Quantitative Precision**: Emphasizing measurable, reproducible metrics over qualitative assessments
2. **Dimensional Comprehensiveness**: Evaluating across all relevant security dimensions
3. **Comparative Standardization**: Enabling meaningful cross-model and cross-version comparison
4. **Actionable Granularity**: Providing sufficient detail to guide specific security improvements
5. **Progressive Adaptation**: Evolving to address emerging attack vectors and model capabilities

### Benchmark Architecture

The framework employs a hierarchical structure with five key components:

1. **Security Dimensions**: Broad categories of security concerns (e.g., prompt injection resistance)
2. **Capability Domains**: Specific abilities within each dimension (e.g., direct vs. indirect injection resistance)
3. **Challenge Sets**: Standardized test cases targeting specific vulnerabilities
4. **Metrics**: Quantitative measures applied to challenge set results
5. **Composite Indices**: Aggregated scores providing high-level security assessments

### Challenge Categories

Within each capability domain, challenges are grouped into four categories:

1. **Baseline Challenges**: Fundamental security expectations
2. **Advanced Exploitation**: Sophisticated attack techniques
3. **Adaptive Defense**: Challenges that respond to model behavior
4. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual scenarios

### Challenge Set Construction Methodology

All challenge sets follow a consistent construction methodology:

## Scoring Methodology

The framework employs a multi-level scoring approach:

### Primary Metric Calculation

Individual metrics are calculated using standardized formulas tailored to each capability domain. Common approaches include:

1. **Failure Rate**: Percentage of challenges where security measures fail
2. **Success Rate**: Percentage of challenges with successful protection
3. **Information Leakage**: Quantification of sensitive information disclosed
4. **Behavioral Deviation**: Degree of deviation from expected secure behavior

### Domain-Level Scoring

Capability domain scores aggregate primary metrics using weighted formulas that balance:

1. **Exploitation Impact**: Potential harm from security failures
2. **Exploitation Likelihood**: Probability of exploitation in real-world scenarios
3. **Detection Difficulty**: Challenge in identifying exploitation attempts
4. **Remediation Complexity**: Difficulty in addressing vulnerabilities

### Dimension-Level Indices

Each security dimension receives a composite index (0-100 scale) calculated from domain scores with:

1. **Critical Domain Weighting**: Higher weights for domains with greater security impact
2. **Minimum Threshold Requirements**: Ensuring critical domains meet minimum standards
3. **Progressive Scaling**: Rewarding exceptional performance in advanced domains

### Overall Security Rating (OSR)

The OSR provides a single top-level assessment using:

1. **Dimension Weighting**: Adjusted based on deployment context and use case
2. **Threshold Requirements**: Minimum acceptable scores for critical dimensions
3. **Penalty Factors**: Substantial reductions for critical vulnerabilities
4. **Bonus Factors**: Recognition of exceptional performance in key areas
