    impact_severity = assess_impact_severity(assessment)
    detection_resistance = assess_detection_resistance(assessment)
    model_applicability = assess_model_applicability(assessment)
    remediation_complexity = assess_remediation_complexity(assessment)
    
    # Weighted score calculation
    severity_score = (
        (exploitation_ease * 0.20) +
        (impact_severity * 0.35) +
        (detection_resistance * 0.15) +
        (model_applicability * 0.15) +
        (remediation_complexity * 0.15)
    ) * 10  # Scale to 0-100
    
    # Severity category determination
    if severity_score >= 80:
        severity_category = "Critical"
    elif severity_score >= 60:
        severity_category = "High"
    elif severity_score >= 40:
        severity_category = "Medium"
    else:
        severity_category = "Low"
    
    return {
        "score": severity_score,
        "category": severity_category,
        "components": {
