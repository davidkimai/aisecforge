## How to Prioritize Security Controls

When implementing security controls, prioritize based on:

1. **Risk Level**: Address high-risk vulnerabilities first
2. **Implementation Complexity**: Balance quick wins with complex controls
3. **Resource Requirements**: Consider available resources for implementation
4. **Compliance Requirements**: Prioritize mandatory compliance controls
5. **Business Impact**: Consider controls with significant business protection

### Risk-Based Prioritization Matrix

| Risk Level | Implementation Difficulty | Priority Level |
|------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| High       | Low                       | 1 - Immediate  |
| High       | Medium                    | 2 - Very High  |
| High       | High                      | 3 - High       |
| Medium     | Low                       | 4 - High       |
| Medium     | Medium                    | 5 - Medium     |
| Medium     | High                      | 6 - Medium     |
| Low        | Low                       | 7 - Medium     |
| Low        | Medium                    | 8 - Low        |
| Low        | High                      | 9 - Very Low   |

## Control Implementation Lifecycle

For each security control, follow this implementation lifecycle:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate applicability and priority
2. **Design**: Create detailed implementation design
3. **Implementation**: Deploy the control
4. **Testing**: Verify control effectiveness
5. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor performance
6. **Improvement**: Regularly enhance and update

## Conclusion

This checklist provides a comprehensive framework for implementing security controls in LLM applications. While not every control will be necessary for every application, this structured approach ensures you consider the full spectrum of security measures during development and deployment.

Remember that security is an ongoing process rather than a one-time implementation. Regularly revisit this checklist to ensure your security controls remain effective as your application and the threat landscape evolve.
