# Advanced Model Boundary Evaluation Framework

This framework provides sophisticated methodologies for assessing the robustness of AI safety systems and boundary enforcement mechanisms. The documentation contained here represents cutting-edge approaches to understanding how language models respond to various forms of adversarial inputs.

> **IMPORTANT**: This module focuses on systematic evaluation rather than exploitation. All techniques are documented for defensive security research purposes, enabling organizations to strengthen their AI systems against potential misuse.

## Core Research Areas

### Classifier Behavior Analysis
Systematic approaches to understanding how safety classifiers make decisions, their activation thresholds, edge cases, and potential blind spots.

### Reinforcement Learning Alignment Assessment
