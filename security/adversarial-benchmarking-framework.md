# AI Adversarial Assessment Protocol

This document outlines a comprehensive, structured methodology for conducting adversarial assessments of language models, ensuring consistent, reproducible security evaluation across different systems and evaluators.

## AVRS: Adversarial Vulnerability Rating System

```markdown
# AVRS: Adversarial Vulnerability Rating System

This document introduces the Adversarial Vulnerability Rating System (AVRS), a comprehensive framework for scoring and categorizing vulnerabilities in AI systems, with specific focus on large language models and generative AI.

## Framework Overview

AVRS provides a structured, multi-dimensional approach to measuring the severity and characteristics of AI vulnerabilities. It enables objective comparison, prioritization, and tracking of security issues across different models, versions, and deployment contexts.

## Core Dimensions

AVRS evaluates vulnerabilities across five primary dimensions:

1. **Exploitation Factors (EF)**: Aspects related to the technical execution of the vulnerability
2. **Impact Factors (IF)**: Potential consequences of successful exploitation
3. **System Factors (SF)**: Characteristics of the affected system that influence risk
4. **Detection Factors (DF)**: Aspects related to identifying exploitation attempts
5. **Remediation Factors (RF)**: Considerations for addressing the vulnerability

Each dimension contains multiple components that are scored individually and combined to create dimension scores and an overall AVRS rating.

## Dimension Components

### 1. Exploitation Factors (EF)

## Scoring Methodology

AVRS uses a systematic calculation approach:

```python
# Pseudocode for AVRS calculation
def calculate_avrs(scores):
    # Calculate dimension scores
    ef_score = (scores['EF1'] * 0.25 + scores['EF2'] * 0.20 + scores['EF3'] * 0.25 + 
               scores['EF4'] * 0.15 + scores['EF5'] * 0.15)
    
    if_score = (scores['IF1'] * 0.25 + scores['IF2'] * 0.20 + scores['IF3'] * 0.20 + 
               scores['IF4'] * 0.15 + scores['IF5'] * 0.20)
    
    sf_score = (scores['SF1'] * 0.25 + scores['SF2'] * 0.20 + scores['SF3'] * 0.15 + 
               scores['SF4'] * 0.20 + scores['SF5'] * 0.20)
    
    df_score = (scores['DF1'] * 0.30 + scores['DF2'] * 0.25 + scores['DF3'] * 0.15 + 
               scores['DF4'] * 0.15 + scores['DF5'] * 0.15)
    
    rf_score = (scores['RF1'] * 0.25 + scores['RF2'] * 0.20 + scores['RF3'] * 0.20 + 
               scores['RF4'] * 0.15 + scores['RF5'] * 0.20)
    
    # Calculate overall AVRS score (0-100 scale)
    avrs_score = ((ef_score * 0.25) + (if_score * 0.30) + (sf_score * 0.15) + 
                 (df_score * 0.15) + (rf_score * 0.15)) * 10
    
    # Determine severity category
    if avrs_score >= 80:
        severity = "Critical"
    elif avrs_score >= 60:
        severity = "High"
    elif avrs_score >= 40:
        severity = "Medium"
    elif avrs_score >= 20:
        severity = "Low"
    else:
        severity = "Informational"
    
    return {
        "dimension_scores": {
            "Exploitation Factors": ef_score * 10,
            "Impact Factors": if_score * 10,
            "System Factors": sf_score * 10,
            "Detection Factors": df_score * 10,
            "Remediation Factors": rf_score * 10
        },
        "avrs_score": avrs_score,
        "severity": severity
    }
```

The final AVRS score is calculated by combining the dimension scores with appropriate weights:
- Exploitation Factors: 25%
- Impact Factors: 30%
- System Factors: 15%
- Detection Factors: 15%
- Remediation Factors: 15%

## Severity Classification

AVRS scores map to qualitative severity ratings:

| Score Range | Severity Rating | Description | Response Priority |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 80-100 | Critical | Severe vulnerabilities with significant exploitation potential and impact | Immediate response required |
| 60-79 | High | Significant vulnerabilities with substantial risk | Urgent response needed |
| 40-59 | Medium | Moderate vulnerabilities with notable but limited risk | Planned response required |
| 20-39 | Low | Minor vulnerabilities with minimal risk | Address as resources permit |
| 0-19 | Informational | Minimal-risk findings or informational issues | Document and monitor |

## Vector String Representation

For efficient communication, AVRS provides a compact vector string format:

```
AVRS:1.0/EF:8.2/IF:7.5/SF:6.1/DF:4.8/RF:3.9/SCORE:6.5
```

Components:
- `AVRS:1.0`: Framework version
- `EF:8.2`: Exploitation Factors score (0-10)
- `IF:7.5`: Impact Factors score (0-10)
- `SF:6.1`: System Factors score (0-10)
- `DF:4.8`: Detection Factors score (0-10)
- `RF:3.9`: Remediation Factors score (0-10)
- `SCORE:6.5`: Overall AVRS score (0-10)

## Vulnerability Classification Taxonomy

AVRS includes a comprehensive taxonomy for categorizing vulnerabilities:

### Primary Categories

Top-level classification of vulnerability types:

| Category Code | Name | Description | Examples |
|---------------|------|-------------|----------|
| PIN | Prompt Injection | Vulnerabilities allowing manipulation of model behavior through crafted inputs | Instruction override, context poisoning |

## MERIT: Model Exploitation Risk Index Taxonomy

```markdown
# MERIT: Model Exploitation Risk Index Taxonomy

This document introduces the Model Exploitation Risk Index Taxonomy (MERIT), a comprehensive framework for assessing the exploitation characteristics of vulnerabilities in AI systems, with particular focus on the technical dimensions of adversarial attacks against language models.

## Framework Overview

MERIT provides a structured approach to understanding and quantifying the technical aspects of vulnerability exploitation, focusing on the methods, resources, expertise, and conditions required for successful attacks. This framework enables precise characterization of exploitation risk factors independent of impact considerations, allowing for targeted defensive prioritization.

## Core Exploitation Dimensions

MERIT evaluates exploitation characteristics across five primary dimensions:

1. **Technical Complexity (TC)**: Technical sophistication required for exploitation
2. **Resource Requirements (RR)**: Resources needed to successfully execute the exploit
3. **Access Requirements (AR)**: Level of system access needed for exploitation
4. **Exploitation Reliability (ER)**: Consistency and dependability of successful exploitation
5. **Detection Evasion (DE)**: Ability to avoid detection during exploitation

Each dimension contains multiple components that are scored individually and combined to create a comprehensive exploitation risk profile.

## Dimension Components

### 1. Technical
