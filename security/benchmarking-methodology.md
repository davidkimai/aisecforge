    vector_resistance = calculate_vector_resistance(assessments['vector_tests'])
    defense_effectiveness = calculate_defense_effectiveness(assessments['defense_tests'])
    comprehensive_coverage = calculate_coverage(assessments['coverage_analysis'])
    implementation_maturity = calculate_maturity(assessments['maturity_assessment'])
    temporal_stability = calculate_stability(assessments['temporal_analysis'])
    
    # Calculate weighted composite score (0-100 scale)
    composite_score = (
        (vector_resistance * 0.35) +
        (defense_effectiveness * 0.25) +
        (comprehensive_coverage * 0.20) +
        (implementation_maturity * 0.15) +
        (temporal_stability * 0.05)
    ) * 10
    
    # Determine rating category
    if composite_score >= 90:
        rating = "Exceptional Security Posture"
    elif composite_score >= 75:
        rating = "Strong Security Posture"
    elif composite_score >= 60:
        rating = "Adequate Security Posture"
    elif composite_score >= 40:
        rating = "Weak Security Posture"
    else:
        rating = "Critical Security Concerns"
    
    return {
        "dimension_scores": {
            "Vector Resistance": vector_resistance * 10,
            "Defense Effectiveness": defense_effectiveness * 10,
            "Comprehensive Coverage": comprehensive_coverage * 10,
            "Implementation Maturity": implementation_maturity * 10,
            "Temporal Stability": temporal_stability * 10
        },
        "composite_score": composite_score,
        "rating": rating
    }
```
