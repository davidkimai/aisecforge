# Multi-Modal Attack Vectors & Cross-Modal Exploits

This document provides a comprehensive classification and analysis of adversarial attack vectors that operate across multiple modalities, exploiting the interactions between different input and output channels in modern AI systems.

## Fundamental Categories

Multi-modal attacks are organized into three fundamental categories:

1. **Cross-Modal Exploit Vectors**: Attacks leveraging transitions between modalities
2. **Modal Inconsistency Vectors**: Attacks exploiting contradictions between modalities

## Research Directions

Key areas for ongoing research in multi-modal attack vectors:

1. **Modal Interaction Dynamics**: Understanding how information flows between modalities

4. **Emergent Multi-Modal Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities that exist only in multi-modal contexts
5. **Defense Co-Evolution**: How defenses adapt across multiple modalities

## Defense Considerations

Effective defense against multi-modal attacks requires:

1. **Cross-Modal Consistency Checking**: Verifying alignment and consistency between modalities
2. **Holistic Multi-Modal Analysis**: Examining inputs across all modalities simultaneously
3. **Modal Boundary Protection**: Securing transitions between different modalities
4. **Representation Isolation**: Limiting vulnerability transfer through representation sharing
5. **Multi-Modal Adversarial Training**: Training systems to resist attacks across modalities
