# Code-Based Adversarial Attack Vectors

This document provides a comprehensive classification and analysis of adversarial attack vectors that operate through code-based inputs and outputs, representing a high-impact modality for AI system security.

## Fundamental Categories

Code-based attacks are organized into three fundamental categories:

1. **Execution Vector Attacks**: Attacks targeting code execution environments
2. **Syntax Manipulation Attacks**: Attacks exploiting code parsing and interpretation
3. **Interpreter Exploitation Attacks**: Attacks leveraging runtime interpretation vulnerabilities

## 1. Execution Vector Classification

## Research Directions

Key areas for ongoing research in code-based attack vectors:

1. **Language Feature Exploitation**: How language-specific features create unique vulnerabilities
2. **Cross-Language Attack Transfer**: How attacks transfer between programming languages
3. **Model Architecture Influence**: How different code processing architectures affect vulnerability
4. **Tool Chain Security**: Securing the broader development and execution environment
5. **Automated Vulnerability Generation**: Using AI to discover new code-based vulnerabilities

## Defense Considerations

Effective defense against code-based attacks requires:

1. **Multi-Level Code Analysis**: Examining code at lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels
2. **Runtime Monitoring**: Implementing execution monitoring and anomaly detection
3. **Sandboxed Execution**: Enforcing strong isolation and resource constraints
4. **Context-Aware Validation**: Validating code within its execution context
5. **Static and Dynamic Analysis**: Combining pre-execution and runtime analysis techniques
