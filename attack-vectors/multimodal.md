# Multimodal Attack Vectors

This directory contains techniques for evaluating model vulnerability to attacks that leverage multiple input modalities, with a focus on how security vulnerabilities manifest when models process images, audio, documents, and code alongside text.

## Overview

Multimodal attack vectors target the interfaces and processing mechanisms that enable language models to handle non-text inputs. These techniques exploit potential inconsistencies in security enforcement across modalities, the challenges of cross-modal content understanding, and the complexity of handling different data types within a unified model architecture.

## Core Attack Vector Categories

### Image-Based Attack Vectors

Techniques leveraging visual inputs to bypass security measures or inject harmful instructions.

- [**Image-Embedded Text Injection**](image-based/embedded-text.md): Exploiting OCR capabilities to process text within images
- [**Visual Semantic Manipulation**](image-based/semantic-manipulation.md): Using visual elements that trigger specific model interpretations
- [**Image-Text Inconsistency Exploitation**](image-based/modal-inconsistency.md): Leveraging differences between visual content and text descriptions
- [**Steganographic Approaches**](image-based/steganography.md): Hiding instructions or triggers within image data

### Cross-Modal Transition Attacks

Techniques that exploit the transitions between different modalities.

- [**Sequential Modal Priming**](cross-modal/sequential-priming.md): Preparing attacks in one modality, executing in another
- [**Modal Context Leakage**](cross-modal/context-leakage.md): Exploiting information transfer between modalities
- [**Modal Interpretation Conflicts**](cross-modal/interpretation-conflicts.md): Leveraging different interpretations across modalities
- [**Modal Translation Manipulation**](cross-modal/translation-manipulation.md): Attacking the translation process between modalities

## Implementation Approach

Each technique in this directory includes:

1. **Conceptual Framework**: The principles underlying the attack vector
2. **Implementation Patterns**: Specific patterns for applying the technique
3. **Effectiveness Variables**: Factors influencing success rates
4. **Detection Mechanisms**: Methods for identifying exploitation attempts
5. **Mitigation Strategies**: Approaches for reducing vulnerability
6. **Testing Protocol**: Standardized methodology for evaluating susceptibility
7. **Case Studies**: Examples of the technique in action (with appropriate safeguards)

## Security Considerations

The techniques documented here are provided for legitimate security testing and defensive purposes only. Implementation examples are designed with appropriate safeguards, including:

- Obfuscation of complete exploit chains
- Focus on patterns rather than specific harmful content
- Emphasis on detection and mitigation
- Explicit inclusion of defensive context

## Effectiveness Evaluation

Multimodal attack vectors are evaluated using the following metrics:

1. **Cross-Modal Transfer Success**: Rate at which attacks successfully transition between modalities
2. **Security Consistency Gap**: Difference in security enforcement between text and non-text modalities
3. **Detection Evasion Rate**: Percentage of attacks that evade modal-specific security measures
4. **Implementation Complexity**: Difficulty of successfully applying the technique
5. **Cross-Model Transferability**: Effectiveness across different multimodal model architectures

## Key Security Challenges

Multimodal attack vectors exploit several fundamental challenges in securing multimodal systems:

### 1. Modal Security Inconsistency

Models often apply different security mechanisms across modalities, creating potential gaps where one modality may have more robust protections than another. Attackers can target the weakest modality as an entry point.

### 2. Cross-Modal Translation Vulnerabilities

The processes that translate between modalities (e.g., image-to-text, text-to-code) introduce additional attack surfaces where information may be interpreted differently across the translation boundary.

### 3. Modal Attention Manipulation

Models distribute attention differently when processing multiple modalities, potentially allowing attackers to direct focus toward seemingly innocuous content while hiding malicious elements in secondary modalities.

### 4. Context Window Fragmentation

Multimodal inputs often consume more context space, potentially fragmenting the model's understanding and creating opportunities for context manipulation attacks.

### 5. Emergent Multimodal Behaviors

Models can exhibit emergent behaviors when processing multiple modalities simultaneously that aren't present when processing single modalities, creating novel attack surfaces.

## Usage Guidelines

When implementing these techniques for security testing:

1. Begin with single-modality baseline testing before exploring cross-modal attacks
2. Test both modal-specific and cross-modal security boundaries
3. Document differences in security enforcement across modalities
4. Evaluate how switching between modalities affects security enforcement
5. Focus on identifying systemic patterns rather than individual exploits

## Research Directions

Current areas of active research in multimodal attack vectors include:

1. Automated generation of cross-modal attack patterns
2. Formal verification of security consistency across modalities
3. Development of unified multimodal security frameworks
4. Quantification of modal security differentials
5. Cross-model transferability of multimodal attacks

## Integration with Other Security Domains

Multimodal attacks often combine with other security dimensions:

1. **Linguistic Pattern Exploitation**: Using sophisticated linguistic patterns in image-embedded text
2. **Contextual Boundary Testing**: Exploiting contextual framing across different modalities
3. **System Prompt Extraction**: Leveraging multiple modalities to extract system instructions
4. **Multi-turn Vulnerability**: Combining multimodal inputs across conversation turns
