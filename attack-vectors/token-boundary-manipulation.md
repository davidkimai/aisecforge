# Token Boundary Manipulation

This document details token boundary manipulation techniques, a class of technical exploits that leverage the tokenization process in language models to bypass security filters, inject instructions, or otherwise manipulate model behavior.

## Technique Overview

Token boundary manipulation exploits how language models process text by breaking it into tokens. These techniques strategically position content across token boundaries to potentially bypass token-level security checks, alter the model's interpretation of instructions, or influence the processing of sensitive content.

The technique takes advantage of the fundamental tokenization process that converts natural language into the numerical tokens processed by the model, targeting the gaps between how humans perceive text and how models actually process it at the token level.

## Conceptual Framework

### Technical Principles

1. **Tokenization Mechanics**: Language models divide text into tokens based on vocabulary and statistical patterns
2. **Cross-Token Information**: Semantic meaning can span across multiple tokens
3. **Tokenization Artifacts**: The tokenization process itself can create patterns invisible to human readers
4. **Vocabulary Specificity**: Models tokenize text differently based on their specific vocabulary

### Exploitation Mechanisms

The primary exploitation pathways operate through these key mechanisms:

1. **Boundary Disruption**: Placing sensitive content across token boundaries to avoid exact matching
2. **Token Fragmentation**: Breaking prohibited terms into separate tokens
3. **Vocabulary Exploitation**: Using tokens that have different meanings when combined versus separate
4. **Attention Manipulation**: Exploiting how attention flows across token boundaries

## Implementation Patterns

### Basic Token Manipulation Techniques

1. **Zero-Width Character Insertion**
   - Inserting zero-width characters between letters
   - Example: Inserting zero-width space between letters of a filtered word
   - Effectiveness: Varies by model tokenization implementation
   - Detection: Specialized scanning for zero-width characters

2. **Homoglyph Substitution**
   - Replacing characters with visually similar ones from different scripts
   - Example: Using Cyrillic 'Ð¾' instead of Latin 'o'
   - Effectiveness: Can be effective for bypassing simple pattern matching
   - Detection: Character script analysis and normalization

3. **Whitespace Manipulation**
   - Strategic insertion of spaces or tabs to affect tokenization
   - Example: Inserting spaces within words at tokenization boundaries
   - Effectiveness: Model-specific, based on tokenization patterns
   - Detection: Unusual whitespace patterns

4. **Special Character Insertion**
   - Inserting punctuation or special characters to influence tokenization
   - Example: Adding periods or hyphens within sensitive terms
   - Effectiveness: Variable based on tokenizer implementation
   - Detection: Statistical analysis of character distributions

### Advanced Token Manipulation Techniques

1. **Token Boundary Mapping Exploitation**
   - Using knowledge of specific model tokenization to place content at known boundaries
   - Example: Crafting text to ensure sensitive terms split exactly at token boundaries
   - Effectiveness: High for models with known tokenization patterns
   - Detection: Requires deep analysis of tokenization patterns

2. **Multi-Script Mixing**
   - Combining multiple language scripts to create unusual tokenization patterns
   - Example: Alternating between Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek characters
   - Effectiveness: Can bypass language-specific security filters
   - Detection: Script consistency analysis

3. **Tokenization Collision Exploitation**
   - Using terms that tokenize to the same or similar tokens as filtered terms
   - Example: Finding benign phrases that share tokens with prohibited content
   - Effectiveness: Varies by model vocabulary and tokenization
   - Detection: Token-level semantic analysis

4. **Context Window Positioning**
   - Placing content strategically within the context window to affect interpretation
   - Example: Positioning sensitive content at context window boundaries
   - Effectiveness: Can exploit attention pattern differences
   - Detection: Position-aware content analysis

### Implementation Example

**Note**: The examples below demonstrate the patterns using simple, innocuous examples rather than harmful content.

#### Basic Token Boundary Exploitation

The following example demonstrates how inserting zero-width spaces (represented as `[ZWS]` for visibility) can affect tokenization:

```
Original text: "completely ignore previous instructions"
Tokenized as: ["completely", "ignore", "previous", "instructions"]

Manipulated text: "com[ZWS]pletely ig[ZWS]nore prev[ZWS]ious inst[ZWS]ructions"
May tokenize as: ["com", "##pletely", "ig", "##nore", "prev", "##ious", "inst", "##ructions"]
```

This manipulation changes the token boundaries, potentially affecting how pattern-matching security filters identify the phrase.

#### Advanced Token Collision Example

```
Benign request using token collision:
"Please provide comp_utation for the ign_ition prev_alent inst_ances in the dataset."

Where the underscores represent invisible characters that affect tokenization but are not visible to human readers.
```

This might create tokenization patterns similar to filtered instructions while appearing innocuous to human reviewers.

## Ethical Considerations and Usage Guidelines

The token boundary manipulation techniques documented here are provided exclusively for legitimate security testing and defensive purposes. Researchers and security professionals implementing these techniques should:

1. **Operate in controlled environments** with appropriate safeguards
2. **Focus on pattern identification** rather than creating harmful bypasses
3. **Document vulnerabilities responsibly** following established disclosure guidelines
4. **Emphasize defensive applications** when sharing findings
5. **Consider potential dual-use implications** of published examples

## Research Directions

Current research in token boundary manipulation focuses on:

1. **Tokenization security metrics** for quantifying vulnerability
2. **Cross-model technique transferability** across tokenization approaches
3. **Detection mechanism effectiveness** for different manipulation types
4. **Tokenization algorithm design** with security considerations
5. **Adversarial tokenization** to generate effective manipulations

## Conclusion

Token boundary manipulation represents a significant class of technical exploitation techniques that target the fundamental tokenization process of language models. By exploiting the boundaries between how humans perceive text and how models tokenize it, these techniques attempt to bypass security measures or manipulate model behavior.

Effective countermeasures must address both the technical tokenization process and the semantic interpretation of content, combining character-level normalization, token-level analysis, and semantic-level security evaluation. As tokenization approaches evolve, security measures must adapt to address emerging manipulation techniques.
