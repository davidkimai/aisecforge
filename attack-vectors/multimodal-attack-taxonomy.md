# Multi-Modal Adversarial Attack Taxonomy: Classification Framework

This document outlines the comprehensive classification system for categorizing adversarial attacks against multi-modal AI systems, providing a structured framework for understanding, researching, and mitigating these threats.

## Taxonomy Structure

The taxonomy is organized hierarchically across multiple dimensions:

1. **Modality Layer**: Primary classification based on the modality being targeted
2. **Vector Category**: Broad categories of attack vectors within each modality  
3. **Attack Class**: Specific classes of attacks within each vector category
4. **Implementation Variant**: Specific implementation approaches for each attack class

This multi-level structure enables precise classification while maintaining a cohesive framework that accommodates new attack vectors as they emerge.

## Complete Classification Example

To illustrate the taxonomy in action, consider this classification example:

```

Vector Details:
- Attack Class: Embedded Text Injection

Description: This attack embeds adversarial prompts within images using steganographic techniques that are invisible to human observers but are processed by the vision system and interpreted as text instructions, enabling extraction of sensitive information while bypassing text-based security filters.
```

## Application to Novel Attack Vectors

The taxonomy is designed to accommodate the classification of novel attack vectors through:

1. **Extensible Structure**: New attack classes can be added within existing categories
2. **Combinatorial Classification**: Novel attacks often combine elements from multiple categories

When documenting a novel attack vector, researchers should:

1. Identify the primary modality and objective
2. Classify the attack surface and complexity
3. Document effectiveness factors and defense interactions
4. Detail the specific implementation approach
5. Provide examples and case studies

## Integration with Other Frameworks

This taxonomy is designed to integrate with other security frameworks:

- **LLMVS**: Use taxonomy classifications as inputs to vulnerability scoring
- **AIRS**: Map attack vectors to intelligence risk dimensions
- **MARA**: Align attack techniques with resistance assessment categories
- **VECTOR**: Use taxonomy for standardized vulnerability documentation
